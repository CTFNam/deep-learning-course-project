# Neonatal Neurology #

For this project, I will train a neural network to perform image segmentation on MRI images of brain lesions found in infants suffering from hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE).

Mortality rates from HIE can range from 15% to 82% in severe cases ([Korf et al., 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10485647/#:~:text=However%2C%20mortality%20for%20severe%20HIE,to%20human%20populations%20(79))). An accurate, well-trained deep learning model could contribute to a reduction in this mortality rate by allowing for timely diagnosis and treatment of this condition and its related complications.

This project is inspired by a challenge listed on the [Grand Challenge](https://bonbid-hie2024.grand-challenge.org/bonbid-hie2024/) website.

This project will be under active development until April 2026. Code and data will be regularly updated as the project progresses throughout the semester.
