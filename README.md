### A Potential Project Idea ###

For this project, I intend to train a neural network to perform image segmentation on MRI images of brain lesions found in infants suffering from hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE).

Mortality rates from HIE can range from 15% to 82% in severe cases ([Korf et al., 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10485647/#:~:text=However%2C%20mortality%20for%20severe%20HIE,to%20human%20populations%20(79))). An accurate model could contribute to a reduction in this mortality rate by allowing for timely diagnosis and treatment of this condition and its related complications.

This project is inspired by a challenge listed on the [Grand Challenge](https://bonbid-hie2024.grand-challenge.org/bonbid-hie2024/) website.

The exact project definition is subject to change, depending on the project's feasibility, the availability of suitable data, and the course instructor's approval.
