# DigiDoc: NLP-Based Diagnostic Assistance #

### A Potential Project Idea ###

For this project, I will train an RNN on a series of patient records, to enable it to learn common patterns of specific diseases, so that it may possibly predict a new patient's likely disorder, if provided with their medical history and symptoms.

This idea is subject to change, depending on the project's feasibility, the availability of suitable data, and the course instructor's approval.
